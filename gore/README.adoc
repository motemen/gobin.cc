== Usage

    gore

After a prompt is shown, enter any Go expressions/statements or commands described below.

To quit the session, type `Ctrl-D`.

== Features

* Line editing with history
* Multiline inputs
* Package importing with completion
* Evaluates any expressions or statements
* No "evaluated but not used"
* Code completion (requires https://github.com/nsf/gocode[gocode])
* Pretty printing (https://github.com/k0kubun/pp[pp] or https://github.com/davecgh/go-spew[spew] recommended)
* Showing documents (requires https://golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc[godoc])
* Auto-importing

== REPL Commands

Some functionalities are provided as colon-commands:

    :import <package path>  Import package
    :print                  Show current source
    :write [<filename>]     Write out current source to file
    :doc <expr or pkg>      Show document (requires godoc)
    :help                   List commands
    :quit                   Quit the session

== Installation

gore uses Go toolchains, so I don't provide binaries.

    go get -u github.com/motemen/gore

Make sure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `$PATH`.

Also recommended:

    go get -u github.com/nsf/gocode
    go get -u github.com/k0kubun/pp # or github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew
    go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc

== FAQ/Caveats

* If you see `too many arguments in call to mainScope.LookupParent` while installing gore,
  run `go get -u golang.org/x/tools/go/types`.
* gore runs code using `go run` for each input. If you have entered time-consuming code,
  gore will run it for each input and take some time.

== TODO

* Undoing input
* Configuration
* :write completion
* Direct editing of code
* Using external sources
* API
